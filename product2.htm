  <p>
    A toner is a liquid skincare product applied after cleansing and before moisturizing. It helps to balance the skin's pH, remove residual impurities, and prepare the skin for better absorption of subsequent products. Toners can be hydrating, exfoliating, or clarifying, depending on their ingredients. Common ingredients include witch hazel, rose water, glycolic acid, and various botanical extracts
